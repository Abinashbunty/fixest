`fixest` offers a tool, the function `etable`, to view estimation tables in `R` or export them to Latex. 

The main advantage of this function is its simplicity: it is completely integrated with other `fixest` functions, making it exceedingly easy to export multiple estimation results with, say, different types of standard-errors. On the other hand, its main limitations are that *i)* only `fixest` objects can be exported, and *ii)* only Latex is supported. 

It also offers a fair deal of customization, and since you can seamlessly change its default values, you can completely transform the style of your tables without modifying a single line of code. 

Note that there exists excellent alternatives to export tables, like for instance [modelsummary](https://cran.r-project.org/package=modelsummary) or [texreg](https://cran.r-project.org/package=texreg); but they are, necessarily, less integrated with `fixest` objects, often necessiting more lines of code to export the same results. 

This document does not describe `etable`'s arguments in details (the help page provides many examples). Rather, it illustrates how to change the style of the table, once and for all.

This document applies to `fixest` version 0.6.0 or higher.

## First example

Using data from the *airquality* data base, let's estimate 5 models:

```{r}
library(fixest)
data(airquality)

setFixest_notes(FALSE) # To avoid messages when NAs are removed

est_noFE = feols(Ozone ~ Solar.R + Wind + Temp, airquality)
est_1FE  = feols(Ozone ~ Solar.R + Wind + Temp | Day, airquality)
est_2FE  = feols(Ozone ~ Solar.R + Wind + Temp | Day + Month , airquality)
est_poly = feols(Ozone ~ Solar.R + Wind + poly(Temp, 3) | Day + Month, airquality)
est_slopes = feols(Ozone ~ Solar.R + Wind | Day + Month[Temp], airquality)
```

To export the results to Latex, we use `etable`. We first set the dictionnary renaming the variables, then we export the results with clustered standard-errors at the Day level:

```{r, eval = TRUE, results = "hide"}
# Dictionary => set only once per session
setFixest_dict(c(Ozone = "Ozone (ppb)", Solar.R = "Solar Radiation (Langleys)",
                 Wind = "Wind Speed (mph)", Temp = "Temperature"))

etable(est_noFE, est_1FE, est_2FE, est_poly, est_slopes, cluster = "Day", tex = TRUE,
       group = list("Temperature (cubic)" = "%poly"), notes = "Estimation of 5 models.")

```

The previous code produces the following table:

What can we notice? First, all variables are appropriately labeled. Second, all standard-errors are clustered by Day, and this is mentioned in the table footer. This is achieved with the argument `cluster`. Third, there's a fixed-effects section telling which model has which fixed-effect. Fourth, the polynomial of the Temperature is not shown, instead there's a line telling which model includes a cubic polynomial. This is achieved with the argument `group`. 

The style of the table is rather sober, but no worries: most of it can be customized.


## Setting the style, once and for all

The argument `style` defines how the table looks. It allows an in-depth customization of the table. The table is split into several components, each allowing some customization. The components of a table and some of its associated keywords are described by the following figure:

![](https://github.com/lrberge/fixest/blob/master/vignettes/images/etable/style_explanation.png?raw=true)

The argument `style` only accepts outputs from the function of the same name. That function is documented and describes the different components that can be found in the previous illustration. 

The function style has two starting points (in the argument `main`), either the style of the first table displayed, either a much more compact style named "aer". The "aer" is illustrated by changing the default style.

#### Changing the default values

To permanently change the default values for function `etable`, just use the function `setFixest_etable`:

```{r}
setFixest_etable(style = style(main = "aer"), fitstat = ~r2, signifCode = NA)
```

And now, using the exact same line of code as in the first example, we obtain a table with a different style:


```{r, results = 'hide'}
etable(est_noFE, est_1FE, est_2FE, est_poly, est_slopes, cluster = "Day", tex = TRUE,
       group = list("Temperature (cubic)" = "%poly"), notes = "Estimation of 5 models.")
```
