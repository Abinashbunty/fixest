# Setting up your computer for benchmarking

This folder contains scripts for setting up the necessary dependencies in
each of the candidate languages to run our benchmarks. In the future, you should
just be able to run

```bash
bash ./main.sh
```

Currently, this only works on MacOS with homebrew and StataSE installed. If you don't mind
not having Stata installed, this will also work on an Ubuntu 20.04 box, e.g., a fresh
AWS box.
