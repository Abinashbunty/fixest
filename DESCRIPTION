Description: Fast and user-friedly estimation of econometric models with multiple fixed-effects. Includes OLS and GLM models and also the negative binomial.
    The core of the package is based on optimized parallel c++ code, scaling especially well for large data sets. 
    Furher provides tools to export and view the results of several estimations with very intuitive design to cluster the standard-errors.
